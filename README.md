- 🔍 **Deep investigation** into how the original VCamera was intended to work.
- 🧩 Discovery and integration of **OpenSDK**, **VirtualApp**, and internal **hooking mechanisms**.
- 🐛 Fixes for compatibility issues with modern Android systems.
- 🚀 Updated code for improved stability, compatibility, and usability.

## 💡 Goal

The purpose of this project is to serve as a stable, working base for developers and researchers interested in app virtualization and Android virtual camera injection techniques.
